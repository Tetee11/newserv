# It would be a bad idea to remove `.meta hide_from_patches_menu` to make this
# patch an option for players to be able to select; either all players on the
# server should have this patch, or none should have it.

# This patch clears the list of unreleased items on the client, so the client
# never creates buggy items when the server generates an item that wasn't
# released on the official servers.
