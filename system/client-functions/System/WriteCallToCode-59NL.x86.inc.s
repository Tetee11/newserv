# This file defines the following function:
#   write_call_to_code(
#     const void* patch_code,
#     size_t patch_code_size,
#     void* call_opcode_address,
#     size_t call_opcode_bytes);
# This function allocates memory for patch_code, copies patch_code to that
# memory, then writes a call opcode to call_opcode_address that calls the code
# in the allocated memory region. The allocated memory is never freed.
# call_opcode_bytes specifies how many bytes at the callsite should be
# overwritten; this value must be at least 5. The first 5 bytes are overwritten
# with the call opcode itself; the rest are overwritten with nop opcodes. If
# the existing data at the call address is already a call opcode, this function
# does nothing.
# This function pops its arguments off the stack before returning.
