// This file documents newserv's quest assembler syntax and format. This is a
// slightly modified copy of the English version of Sega's Lost HEAT SWORD quest
// for PSO GC.

// Generally the metadata directives should appear before the quest's code.
// These specify the quest's name, description, and other information.

// The .version directive specifies which version of the game the quest is for.
// The values are DC_NTE, DC_11_2000, DC_V1, DC_V2, PC_V2, GC_NTE, GC_V3,
// GC_EP3_NTE, GC_EP3, XB_V3, and BB_V4. This determines which set of opcodes
// to use during compilation, and also specifies the header format and string
// encoding. This does not affect where the quest appears in menus, so for
// versions that use the same opcodes, headers, and string encodings, it is OK
// to use a symbolic link (hence q058-xb-e.bin.txt is a link to this file).
.version GC_V3

// The .quest_num directive specifies the internal number of the quest. This
// has no meaning for online quests, though it's recommended for this value to
// match the number in the filename. For download quests, the game deduplicates
// quest files with the same number, so download quests should all have unique
// numbers in this field. On Episodes 1&2, this field must be in the range
// 0-255; on other versions, it can be 0-65535, but generally numbers less than
// 1000 are recommended.
.quest_num 58

// The .language field specifies the internal language of the quest. On console
// versions (DC, GC, and XB), this affects how strings are encoded - Japanese
// uses Shift-JIS and other languages use ISO8859. (On PC V2 and BB, UTF-16 is
// used for strings in all languages.) The language values are:
//   0 = Japanese
//   1 = English
//   2 = German
//   3 = French
//   4 = Spanish
//   5 = Chinese (simplified)
//   6 = Chinese (traditional)
//   7 = Korean
.language 1

// The .episode directive specifies the quest's episode. The server ignores this
// if a set_episode or set_episode2 opcode is present in the code following the
// start label.
.episode Episode1

// These directives specify the quest's name, short description, and long
// description. Non-ASCII characters can be used here and in the script below;
// this entire file is encoded as UTF-8 and strings are transcoded to the
// encoding the client expects based on the .version and .language directives.
// Common escape codes (e.g. \n for a newline) are supported in these strings.
.name "Lost HEAT SWORD"
.short_desc "Retrieve a\nweapon from\na Dragon!"
.long_desc "Client:  Hopkins, hunter\nQuest:\n My weapon was taken\n from me when I was\n fighting a Dragon.\nReward:  ??? Meseta\n\n\n"

// On BB, quests may specify a maximum number of players with this directive. If
// not given, the default is 4. On non-BB versions, this directive is ignored.
// .max_players 4

// On BB, quests may be joinable while in progress. This directive enables that
// capability.
// .joinable

// The quest script begins after the header directives. A quest script is a
// sequence of opcodes, and labels denoting positions within that sequence that
// can be jumped to or called like a function. All labels have names, and some
// have numbers. (In the compiled format, labels have only numbers and no names;
// during compilation, each label that doesn't have a number is assigned a
// number that isn't in use by another label.) To explicitly specify a label
// number (for example, if an object or NPC refers to a label by number), use an
// @ sign followed by the desired number. Note that numbers can be specified in
// decimal or hexadecimal; see on_talk_to_npc1 and on_talk_to_npc2 for examples.

// Registers may be named as well as labels. (In the compiled script, registers
// do not have names, so disassembling a quest script always produces only
// numbered registers.) When compiling, all of the following are valid:
//   r83                    (explicitly numbered register)
//   r:difficulty_level     (the compiler will assign an unused register number)
//   r:difficulty_level@83  (named and explicitly numbered)
// You don't always have to use the same form for each register; for example,
// if you use r:difficulty_level@83 anywhere in the quest script, you can also
// use r:difficulty_level and r83 in other places and they will all refer to the
// same register. (However, if you don't use r:difficulty_level@83 anywhere, but
// you do use r83 and r:difficulty_level, the compiler will assign these to two
// different registers since there is nothing linking the name to the number.)

// Using opcodes that take a consecutive sequence of registers, such as
// map_designate which takes 4, introduces constraints on which registers may be
// assigned to which numbers. For example, before one of the map_designate
// opcodes after the start label, we explicitly assign one register's number,
// but leave the nearby registers' numbers unassigned. The compiler assigns
// those four registers to r60-r63, because they are used in a map_designate
// call. If we didn't explicitly number any of those registers, the compiler
// would instead choose a consecutive sequence of register numbers that aren't
// used anywhere else in the script.

// This quest does not contain any examples of non-script data, but such data
// can be included in the quest script using the .data directive, like this:
//   hello_symbol_chat:
//     .data 28000000 FFFF 0D00 FFFF FFFF 05 18 1D 00 05 28 1D 01 36 20 2A 00 3C 00 32 00 FF 00 00 00 FF 00 00 00 FF 00 00 00 FF 00 00 02 FF 00 00 02 FF 00 00 02 FF 00 00 02 FF 00 00 02
// You can also include binary data from another file in the same directory
// (the contents of the file are "pasted" into the assembled script, as if you
// had pasted in the hex along with a .data directive):
//   movement_data:
//     .include_bin  movement_data.bin
// There is also a directive for including a large number of zero bytes:
//   lots_of_zeroes:
//     .zero 0x400  // 1024 bytes of zeroes

// There is also a way for quest scripts to include other files. This works by
// simply "pasting" the contents of the file in place of the include directive,
// so all labels in the included file will be accessible from the file that
// included it. newserv looks for the included file in the same directory as
// the quest file, then looks in the system/quest/includes directory. Here's
// the syntax:
//     .include my-function.txt

// Every quest must have a start label; this is the main thread that starts when
// the quest begins. The start label is always assigned number 0.
